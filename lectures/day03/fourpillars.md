# Four Pillars
--
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
--
# Abstraction
- abstraction is focus on essential qualities of an item <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- interfaces <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
--
# Polymorphism
> an object or function can take many different forms
--
# Inheritance
> the idea that we pass along attributes and methods from one class into a "sub-class" or child class, and not have to re-write the code to make it work. <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
- subclass = child class<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
- superclass = parent class<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
--
# Encapsulation
- encapsulation == oop <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
- binding state(data) and behavior(operations on said data) into a single unit <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
