# guessing game


## User Story: As a player of the game, I want to enter a number as a guess. I want the game to tell me if my number is too high, too low, or if I guessed correctly. I want to be allowed a finite number of guesses.

## psuedocode 

// prompt the user for a number between 1 100;
// generate a random number;
// start loop if(attempts less than max, they still )
// get number from the user;
// track number of attempts;
// compare input number with generated number
    // if too low prompt again for another guess
    // if too high prompt for a new guess
    // if they guess it end
