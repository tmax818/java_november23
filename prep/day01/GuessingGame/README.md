# guessing game


## User Story: As a player of the game, I want to enter a number as a guess. I want the game to tell me if my number is too high, too low, or if I guessed correctly. I want to be allowed a finite number of guesses.

## psuedocode 

- generate a random number for the user to guess
- prompt the user for a guess
- compare the user guess to the generated number:
  - if the guess is correct:
    -  end
  - if the number is too high/low:
    - indicate high low
    - prompt for another guess
